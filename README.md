- Automate with Bash or Ansible
- Harden Linux and manage firewalls

### ☁️ Level 3: Cloud & Monitoring
- Launch AWS EC2, use S3, IAM, and CLI
- Monitor with Netdata, Prometheus, Grafana
- Back up with rsync or cloud automation

### 🔄 Level 4: CI/CD & Infra as Code
- Build CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Jenkins
- Use Ansible & Terraform for infrastructure
- Adopt GitOps workflows

### 🔐 Level 5: Security & Portfolio Projects
- Harden servers (SSH, fail2ban, sysctl)
- Centralize logs (rsyslog, Loki, dashboards)
- Create GitHub-worthy DevOps projects

### 🛠️ Bonus: System Admin Ops (NEW!)
